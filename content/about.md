Summary: Short version for index and feeds

Mario is the CTO and co-founder of Soma Energy, a technology company that builds AI systems to optimize energy assets — including storage, generators, and controllable loads.

Before Soma, Mario worked at AWS developing AI models to optimize Amazon's energy projects. As a research scientist, he helped Amazon successfully manage one of the world's largest renewable energy portfolios. Later, as tech lead at Equilibrium Energy, he developed high-performance optimization algorithms for grid-scale batteries.

Mario holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering with a focus on autonomous decision-making. His doctoral research produced a novel algorithm and solver for semidefinite programming — a subset of convex optimization problems.
